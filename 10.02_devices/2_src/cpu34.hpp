 24-jul-2026  JH      created

 The KD11-EA core in cpu34/ started as a fork of the 11/20 KA11 core. It now
 has the KT11-D memory management (cpu34/kt11d.c) with kernel/user modes, plus
 EIS, MFPS/MTPS and the 11/34 SWAB behaviour.

 register_count stays 0 (set by cpu_base_c): the KT11-D registers (MMR0..MMR2
 and the kernel/user PAR/PDR blocks) are internal to the CPU, exactly as on
 real hardware, and are decoded by kd11ea.c dati()/dato(). They are therefore
 not published as QUNIBUS registers and cannot be reached by other bus
 masters - use "examine state" to see them.
