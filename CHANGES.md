## Unreleased

### Pluggable CPU emulations, PDP-11/34 (KD11-EA) added alongside the 11/20

The emulated CPU was hardwired to Angelo Papenhoff's KA11 (PDP-11/20) core. It is now possible to
add further CPU models and to select one of them at runtime.

**New abstraction**

- `10.02_devices/2_src/cpu.hpp` / `cpu.cpp` — `cpu_c` renamed to `cpu_base_c` and reduced to what is
  independent of the CPU model: the console switches, the `PC`/`switch_reg`/`breakpoint`/
  `cycle_count`/`pmi`/`cycle_tracefilepath` parameters, `worker()`, `start()`/`stop()`, the power
  event handling, the QUNIBUS cycle trace buffer and the `unibone_*()` bus adapter.
  A CPU model is attached through pure virtual hooks: `core_condstep()`, `core_reset()`,
  `core_setintr()`, `core_pwrfail_trap()`, `core_pwrup_vector_fetch()`, `core_printstate()`,
  `core_tracestate()`, `core_get_state()`/`core_set_state()`, `core_get_pc()`/`core_set_pc()`,
  `core_set_switches()` and the optional `core_apply_options()`. Model independent run states are
  `cpu_base_c::cpu_state_e`.
- `10.02_devices/2_src/cpu_bus_adapter.h` (new) — the contract between an emulation core and the ARM
  side (`unibone_dati/dato/datob`, `unibone_grant_interrupts`, `unibone_prioritylevelchange`,
  `unibone_bus_init`, `unibone_log`, `trace()`, ...) in one header. The prototypes used to be
  duplicated by hand in `cpu20/11.h` and `cpu20/ka11.c`, so the cores can no longer drift apart.

**CPU models**

- `10.02_devices/2_src/cpu20.hpp` / `cpu20.cpp` (new) — `cpu20_c` "CPU20" / "PDP-11/20". Holds the
  KA11 core state and the 11/20 specific parameters `swab_vbit`, `extended_inst` and `allow_mxps`.
  Pure refactoring, no change in behaviour.
- `10.02_devices/2_src/cpu34/` (new) — `kd11ea.c`, `kd11ea.h`, `11.h`: the KD11-EA core, forked from
  `cpu20/ka11.c`. All externally visible symbols renamed `kd11ea_*` / `KD11EA`, internal helpers made
  `static`, so both cores link into one binary. The 11/20 options are compiled in permanently
  (`KD11EA_EXTENDED_INSTR`, `KD11EA_ALLOW_MXPS`, `KD11EA_SWAB_VBIT`).
- `10.02_devices/2_src/cpu34.hpp` / `cpu34.cpp` (new) — `cpu34_c` "CPU34" / "PDP-11/34".

  Work in progress: the fork still executes the 11/20 instruction set. Search for `TODO 11/34` for
  what is missing, above all the KT11-D memory management (MMR0..MMR3 and the kernel/user PAR/PDR
  blocks, 16 -> 18 bit relocation in `ubxt()`). The 11/34 will be the first CPU which has to publish
  QUNIBUS registers; until then `register_count` stays 0.

**Selecting a CPU**

- Menu `dc` ("Emulate devices and CPU") now instantiates all CPU models but enables **none** of them.
  Previously it enabled the 11/20 automatically. Select one with the usual device commands:
  `en CPU20` or `en CPU34`, switch with `dis CPU20` + `en CPU34`. The menu header shows which CPU is
  active. Menu `d` still instantiates no CPU at all.
- Only one CPU may be enabled at a time: the cores reach the ARM side through a single installed CPU
  and `qunibusadapter_c` accepts one registered CPU. Enabling a second one is now refused by
  `cpu_base_c::on_before_install()` with an error message. Before, this situation would have hit
  `assert(registered_cpu == NULL)` in `qunibusadapter.cpp` and aborted the program.

**Build**

- `makefile_u` and `makefile_q`: added `cpu20.o`, `cpu34.o` and `kd11ea.o`.

**Verified**: cross compile (`./crossco -a`) links cleanly for UNIBUS and for QBUS, no new compiler
warnings, both cores present in the binary without symbol collisions. Not yet tested on real
hardware.
