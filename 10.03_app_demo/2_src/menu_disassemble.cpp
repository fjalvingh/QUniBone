 The disassembler itself is 90_common/src/pdp11disas.cpp and knows nothing
 about a bus. Here it is connected to the two memories "demo" can read - the
 QBUS/UNIBUS via DMA and the shared DDR memory - and wrapped in the page-wise
 output the "da"/"xda" commands use.

 Whoever else wants a code listing calls application_c::disassemble() with one
 of the two memory objects below, so this is not tied to one menu.
