.print NanoVMS044-1M is a very small version of VMS V4.4 made for testing purpose.
.print It runs with only 1MB memory (included on the KA630 MicroVAX II CPU board).
.print It is below 10MB in size and thus fits onto an RD51 or RL02.
.print Log in with Username: SYSTEM, no password required.
.print Because of the small disk and memory size the functionality is limited,
.print although a lot of things still work.
