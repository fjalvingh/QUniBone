# Drop-in MAINDEC diagnostic tapes

Put DEC absolute loader tape images here and they are run by the CPU test suite
on the next build. No makefile edit is needed: the tapes are found by wildcard.
Both extensions of the same format are matched — `.BIN`, as paper tape images
are usually named, and `.BIC`, as the XXDP distributions name them.

| directory | run against |
|---|---|
| `both/`  | every emulation core |
| `cpu20/` | the KA11 (PDP-11/20) core only |
| `cpu34/` | the KD11-EA (PDP-11/34) core only |

The 13 PDP-11/20 instruction set diagnostics **ZKAAA0 … ZKAMA0** are also wired
in, from where they are vendored at
`10.02_devices/2_src/cpu20/pdp11-master/maindec/`, and are run against both
cores. They do not need to be copied here.

## Test results

This is the state of the suite; it is what the build reports, not a wish list.
Only the failures of a test are described here — how a defect was fixed belongs
in `CHANGES.md` (repo root) and `10.02_devices/2_src/cpu34/CHANGES.md`.

The description of a tape is its own banner text where it prints one; where it
does not, it says what the run is seen to exercise.

| tape | what it tests | cpu20 | cpu34 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ZKAAA0` … `ZKAMA0` (13 tapes) | MAINDEC-11-DZKAA … DZKAM, the PDP-11/20 instruction set tests. No banner text; vendored with the 11/20 core | **PASS** (13/13) | **PASS** (13/13) |
| `cpu34/FKAAC0` | MAINDEC-11-DFKAA-C, "11/34 BSC INST TST" — basic instruction set | — | **PASS** (10888 instructions) |
| `cpu34/FKABD1` | MAINDEC-11-DFKAB-D, "11/34 TRAPS TST" — trap vectors, trap-within-trap, the kernel stack limit, the reserved instructions, interrupt priority and the WAIT | — | **PASS** (319027 instructions) |
| `cpu34/FKACA0` | MAINDEC-11-DFKAC-A, no banner — EIS (MUL/DIV/ASH/ASHC) and MFPS/MTPS exerciser | — | **PASS** (4847 instructions) |
| `cpu34/FKTAA0` | MAINDEC-11-DFKTA-A, "11/34 MEMORY MANAGEMENT LOGIC TEST" — KT11-D registers and relocation | — | **PASS** (13951998 instructions) |
| `cpu34/FKTBA0` | MAINDEC-11-DFKTB-A, "11/34 MEMORY MANAG. ACCESS KEYS TEST" — PDR access control | — | **PASS** (1818981 instructions) |
| `cpu34/FKTCA0` | MAINDEC-11-DFKTC-A, no banner — MFPI/MTPI/MFPD/MTPD between the kernel and user spaces | — | **PASS** (758275 instructions) |
| `cpu34/FKTDA1` | MAINDEC-11-DFKTD-A, no banner — mode protection: HALT and RESET outside kernel mode, previous-mode instructions, device interrupts | — | **PASS** (63805 instructions) |
| `cpu34/FKTFA0` | MAINDEC-11-DFKTF-A, no banner — MMU aborts and the frozen MMR0/MMR1/MMR2 | — | **PASS** (2931203 instructions) |
| `cpu34/FKTGC0` | MAINDEC-11-DFKTG-C, no banner — drives the KL11 console itself | — | **SKIP** (`ignore = 1`) |
| `cpu34/FKTHB0` | MAINDEC-11-DFKTH-B, "11/34 MEMORY MGMT. DIAG." — full KT11-D diagnostic | — | **PASS** (60038 instructions) |

35 of 36 runs pass, 1 is skipped, **none fail**. There is no expected-failure
mechanism, so a defect a tape finds turns the build red until it is fixed;
`SKIP_CPUTESTS=1` or `./crossco -n` builds without running the tests at all.

`FKTGC0` is skipped rather than failed because it tests console hardware the
fake bus does not have, so its result says nothing about the CPU core: it sends
the whole character set 0…177 round and round through the interrupt driven KL11
transmitter and halts at 003300 after 13 sweeps. Its `.opt` sidecar sets
`ignore = 1`, and keeps `bell-is-pass = 0` for whenever it is re-enabled — a BEL
is character 007 of its sweep, so this is the one tape whose console traffic is
data and where a BEL must **not** be read as end of pass.

`FKTHB0` is judged on its text and not on a BEL, and the text it is judged on
reaches into a number — see [How a run is judged](#how-a-run-is-judged) below.

## A tape needs different settings?

Put a `<tape>.opt` file next to it, with `key = value` lines:

```
# needs more than 28K words and runs long
ram-words = 61440
maxsteps  = 800000000
```

Recognized keys are `maxsteps`, `ram-words`, `sw` (octal), `tracelines`,
`bell-is-pass`, `pass-text` and `ignore` — the long forms of the `cputest`
options, without the leading dashes. A value runs to the end of the line, so
`pass-text` may contain blanks. `ignore = 1` skips the tape entirely: the runner
prints a `SKIP` line and exits 0, for a tape that is out of scope for this
harness (e.g. one testing hardware the fake bus does not have) rather than one
finding a real core defect. Run `4_deploy/cputest --help` for the defaults.

## How a run is judged

A diagnostic passes when it prints a BEL character to the KL11 console, which is
how a MAINDEC signals "end of pass, no errors". It fails if the CPU halts (how a
MAINDEC reports an error) or if it never finishes within `maxsteps`.

That rule only holds for a tape which uses the console to talk to the operator.
One which exercises the KL11 as a device sends the whole character set as test
data, BEL included, and would be judged passed on its seventh character. Such a
tape sets `bell-is-pass = 0` in its `.opt` sidecar and has to be judged some
other way; `cpu34/FKTGC0.BIC` is the one example here.

A tape which announces the end of a pass in words instead of with a BEL is
judged on that text: `pass-text = END PASS` in its sidecar passes the run as
soon as the KL11 has printed that string. `cpu34/FKAAC0.BIC` and
`cpu34/FKACA0.BIC` both do this — they print `END PASS 1`, `END PASS 2`, … and
report an error by halting, so the first such line, reached without a halt, is a
clean pass. `cpu34/FKABD1.BIC` is judged the same way, on the `DONE` of the
`CFKABD1 11/34 TRAPS TST DONE` it prints per pass.

`cpu34/FKTHB0.BIC` announces the end of a pass in words too, but it does not
halt on an error — it prints the failed tests and carries on to

```
END PASS #     1  TOTAL ERRORS SINCE LAST REPORT      0
```

so "end of pass" and "no errors" are on the same line and only the two together
are a pass. Its `pass-text` therefore reaches into the error count rather than
stopping at `END PASS`, which on its own would pass the tape while it was still
printing failures. A count of ten or more reads `     10` and does not match.

On failure the run is replayed with tracing on to show the instructions leading
up to it, followed by a dump of the CPU and MMU state. It is exact, because the
fake bus is fully deterministic. To reproduce one by hand:

```bash
10.05_cputest/4_deploy/cputest --core cpu34 \
    --tape 10.05_cputest/3_tapes/cpu34/FKTHB0.BIC --tracelines 40
```
