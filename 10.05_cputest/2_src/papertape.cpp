 Ported from loadpt() in 10.02_devices/2_src/cpu20/pdp11-master/1120.c, the
 loader of Angelo Papenhoff's standalone PDP-11 emulator. Same tape format, but
 the words go into a testbus_c instead of a global array, and a botched tape is
 reported instead of printed.

 Tape format: a stream of blocks, each

	001 000  <count:16 lo,hi>  <load address:16 lo,hi>  <count-6 data bytes>  <checksum>

 with all bytes of the block summing to 0 mod 256. Anything before the leading
 001 000 is leader and skipped. A block whose load address is 1 is the end
 block, its address field is the start address (which we ignore: the tests set
 the PC themselves).
