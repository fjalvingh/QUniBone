 A command file names other files: disk images, MACRO-11 listings, a shared
 host directory. It means them relative to itself - the script and its data
 travel together - while the user starts it from wherever they happen to stand.

 So a file name from a script is looked up in the script's directory first, and
 that is all this does. It is deliberately NOT a chdir() into that directory:
 then everything the application *creates* would land next to the script too,
 while the natural place for new files is the directory the script was started
 from.

 The rule is therefore: an existing file is found next to the script, a new file
 is created in the current working directory. See scriptpath_resolve().

// The path under which to open a file named by the script or the user:
//	- if no script directory is known, or <path> is absolute: <path> unchanged
//	- if <path> is relative and exists in the script directory: that one
//	- else <path> unchanged, so it refers to the current working directory
// Use this for every file which is *read*, and for one which is opened if it
// exists and created if it does not - a disk image. Do NOT use it for a file the
// application only ever writes (a memory dump, a trace, a log): those belong in
// the directory the user started the script from, which is what an unresolved
// relative path means.
